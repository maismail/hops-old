        <para>In each cluster, top level stuff that are defined are services, each service consists of a few roles and each role is played by a one or number of machines. In the 
            dashboard if you step into "Manage Clusters" you will see table of available clusters if you have already something defined, besides, you can define your own cluster. 
        You can either choose to restore cluster definition from YML file or you can start defning new one by using GUI wizard as in /ref-def-cluster0.</para>
        <para>In the cloud provider wizard choose your cloud provider, git repository of installation recepiet code, the global recepiet and global ports. In the second page you

        <para>Dashboard supplies you with number of views and graphs to watch status of the resources in your clusters. You can browes your physical resources, services that are 
        functioning, status of the processes that are run on each machine and performance of all resources.</para>
        <para>To begin with, as you step into the "Clusters" page, you will see table of available cluster with the short summary of your cluster. This summary displays all the 
            services, it they are active or stopped processing, its availabale roles and aggregated availabe of memory, cores and disk space. If you click on one of the services 
        you will get into service page with its health summary. By selecting one role, you will be lead into the detail page of that role wich shows all instances of the role and
        machines that have that role running. After all, you can get into detail of each machine, number cores it has, its ip address, its failure status, the average load, amount 
            of memory and disk space. There is also another section that you can find tail of the logs of each machine that could be useful in case of failuer and malfunctioning.</para>
        <para>It is also possible to have some graphs for the cluster, in the perspective bar if you select "Edit Graphs", you will see that you can import graph definitions or 
            define your own. Graphs are defined in a JSON format, they are defined for a service or a role, therefore you need to specify type of the graph at the time of importing or
        defining new one. In case you import/define graphs in the dashboard, they will show up in the bottom page of the related views such as services, roles oir hosts.</para>
