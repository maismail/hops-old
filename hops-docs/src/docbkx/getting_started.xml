    <title>Hop Web Portal</title>

    <para>This section describes how to setup a Hop cluster on either a cloud provider
        or a baremetal cluster from our website, Hop web portal. 
        Hop web portal is a web application where users can register, enter the credentials 
        for their cloud provider (or ssh keys for their cluster) can from there, 
        they can launch the Hop Dashboard on their target infrastructure. 
        The Hop Dashboard is a web application that can be used to provision and 
        configure the rest of the cluster. Hop Dashboard provides a
        centralized end-to-end management and monitoring application for Hop clusters. </para>

                        The recommended instance to use in OpenStack infrastructure 
                        should be the equivalent to a m1.large instance type or greater.

        <title>Installing the Hop Dashboard</title>
        <para>Intalling Hop Dashboard through the Portal is quite simple and takes a couple of
            minutes to deploy. Here you may find instructions on how to deploy the dashboard on AWS,
            OpenStack and Baremetal Machine.
